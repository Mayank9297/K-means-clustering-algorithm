## K-Means Customer Segmentation for Retail Store

This repository implements a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. 

This can be a valuable tool for:

* **Customer segmentation:** Identify distinct customer groups with similar purchasing behaviors.
* **Targeted marketing:** Develop targeted marketing campaigns for each customer segment based on their preferences.
* **Personalized recommendations:** Recommend products that are likely to appeal to each customer segment.

### Usage

This code requires Python and the following libraries:

* pandas
* scikit-learn

**1. Data Preparation**

* Place your customer data in a CSV file named `Mall_Customers.csv`.
* The data should include customer ID and features related to their purchase history (e.g., product category, amount spent, frequency).

**2. Running the Script**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install pandas scikit-learn`
3. Run the script: `python kmeans_customer_segmentation.py`

**3. Output**

* The script will generate a new CSV file named `clustered_data.csv`.
* This file contains your original customer data along with an additional column named `'cluster'`. This column indicates the cluster assigned to each customer based on their purchase behavior.

**4. Analysis**

* Use the `clustered_data.csv` file to analyze customer segments and identify patterns in their purchase history.

### Code Structure

The script (`kmeans_customer_segmentation.py`) includes the following functionalities:

1. Loads customer data from a CSV file.
2. Selects relevant features related to purchase history.
3. Performs feature scaling (optional, recommended for features with different units).
4. Defines the number of clusters (k) based on your analysis (experiment with different values).
5. Implements K-means clustering using scikit-learn.
6. Assigns clusters to each customer.
7. Exports the data with cluster labels to a new CSV file.

### Additional Notes

* This code provides a basic framework. You might need to adapt it to your specific data and analysis goals.
* Consider exploring the "Elbow Method" to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for your data.
